# Documentation
We live in the era of big data. For each topic, we have a huge amount of data that we can analyze. Powerful tools have been created over the years to manage big data. In this document, we will try to use these tools to make an in-depth analysis of one of the largest pandemics the world has ever suffered. We are talking about Covid-19. In the past two years of the pandemic, a vast amount of epidemiological data has been collected. We have created a platform for visualizing this data, using the latest available Visual Analytics techniques. We have come up with a solution that can help users better understand information about COVID-19 deaths, cases, and vaccines with a focus on the European countries.
